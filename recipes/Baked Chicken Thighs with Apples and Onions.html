<ul><span>
        <li><p>(4 ounce) bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</p></li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li><p>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p></li>
        <li><p>1 medium onion, sliced</p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup apple cider</p></li>
       <li> <p>½ cup chicken stock</p></li>
        <li><p>½ tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</p></li>
       <li><p>½ teaspoon salt</p></li>
       <li><p>2 medium apples, sliced</p></li>
       <li><p>¼ cup heavy cream</p></li>
       <li><p>1 tablespoon cornstarch</p></li>
        </span></ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ul><span class="bold" style="font-weight: normal"
        ></span>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <p>Season both sides of chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Heat oil in a deep oven-proof skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add</p>
<p>chicken thighs to hot oil and cook until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes</p>
<p>per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and keep warm.</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Add sliced onions to the skillet and sauté until they just start to brown, about 3</p>
<p>minutes. Pour in apple cider and chicken stock, scraping the bottom of the pan</p>
<p>to loosen any browned bits. Stir in thyme and salt. Simmer until onions are soft,</p>
<p>4 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Add chicken back to the skillet and spoon some sauce over the top. Arrange</p>
<p>sliced apples around chicken. Cover the skillet with a lid or aluminum foil.</p>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove skillet from the oven and</p>
<p>carefully uncover. Transfer chicken from the skillet to a plate and keep warm.</p>
<p>Whisk heavy cream and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Stir gently into</p>
<p>sauce in the skillet. Place chicken back into the skillet and spoon some of sauce</p>
<p>over chicken.</p>
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Return skillet to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the chicken is no longer</p>
<p>pink at the bone and juices run clear, and an instant-read thermometer inserted</p>
<p>near bone reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes more.</p>
<p>Serve chicken and apples with sauce.</p>
</ul>
